## Send a Streaming Message

Available from client version 3.67.

To send a message that displays progressively to the user (typewriter effect), use the streaming APIs. Streaming is supported for text and interactive messages.

No additional permission required — streaming uses the same Send Message to Bot User permission.

&rarr; See Send Streaming Messages (https://open.seatalk.io/docs/Send-streaming-message) for the full integration guide.

## Send a Markdown Message (Phasing out)

**Note**:

- SeaTalk is phasing out the "Markdown" message type in favor of the more flexible markdown formatting syntax concept that can be embedded into not only text messages but all applicable message types.

- It is recommended to use the "text" message type in producing formatted text messages.
